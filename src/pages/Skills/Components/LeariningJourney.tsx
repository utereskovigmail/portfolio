                    I have been studying at a <strong>specialized programming school (IT STEP SCHOOL)</strong> for three years, where I
                    gained a strong foundation in computer science and software
                    development. Alongside my formal education, I have been actively
                    engaged in <strong>self-learning</strong> â€” exploring new technologies,
                    building personal projects, and deepening my understanding of web
                    development. This combination of structured learning and independent
                    study has helped me develop both technical skills and a genuine
                    passion for creating useful digital solutions.
